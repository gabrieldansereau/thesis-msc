# Introduction

Beta diversity, defined as the variation in species composition among sites in a geographic region of interest [@Legendre2005AnaBet], is an essential measure to describe the organization of biodiversity through space. Total beta diversity within a community can be partitioned into local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) [@Legendre2013BetDiv], which allows the identification of sites with exceptional species composition, hence unique biodiversity. Such a method, focusing on specific sites, is useful for both community ecology and conservation biology, as it highlights areas that are most important for their research or conservation values. For example, sites with unique community composition often differ from those with high species richness, possibly as they harbour rare species or help maintain beta diversity [@daSilva2018DisCor; @Heino2017UnrCor; @Landeiro2018SpeLow]. Hence, focusing on unique community composition may prove useful as a complementary approach to species richness [@Heino2017ExpSpe; @daSilva2018DisCor; @Yao2021EcoUni; @Dubois2020EcoUni]. However, the use of LCBD indices is currently limited in two ways. First, LBCD indices are typically used on data collected over local or regional scales with relatively few sites, for example on fish communities at intervals along a river or stream [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Second, LCBD calculation methods require complete information on community composition, such as a community composition matrix $Y$; thus, they are inappropriate for partially sampled sites (e.g., where data for some species is missing or uncertain) and cannot directly provide assessments for unsampled ones. Accordingly, the method is of limited use to identify areas with exceptional biodiversity in regions with sparse sampling. However, predictive approaches are increasingly common given the recent development of computational methods, which often uncover novel ecological insights from existing data [@Poisot2019DatSyn], including in unsampled or lesser-known locations, as well as larger spatial scales. Thus, biodiversity modelling can fill in knowledge gaps and needs to be better integrated with conservation decisions [@Pollock2020ProBio].

Species distribution models (SDMs) [@Guisan2005PreSpe] can bring a new perspective to LCBD studies by filling in gaps and performing analyses on much broader scales. In a community matrix $Y$, such as required for LCBD calculation, ecological communities are abstracted as assemblages of species present at different sites. Viewing communities as such opens the perspective of predicting community composition from predictions of individual species, which is the aim of SDMs, thus allowing calculating LCBD values. At their core, SDMs aim at predicting the distribution of a species based on information about where the species was previously reported, matched with environmental data at those locations, and then make predictions at other (unsampled) locations based on their respective environmental conditions. Community-level modelling from SDMs is not an especially novel idea [@Ferrier2002ExtSta; @Ferrier2006SpaMod], but it is increasingly relevant with the advent of large-scale, massive, and open data sources on species occurrences, often contributed by citizens, such as GBIF and eBird [@Sullivan2009EbiCit]. 

Many approaches allow going from single-species SDMs to a whole community, although these have not been explicitly evaluated for ecological uniqueness and LCBD indices. The simplest approach is stacked distribution models (S-SDMs) [@Ferrier2006SpaMod; @Guisan2011SesNew]. Single species SDMs are first performed separately, then combined to form a community prediction on which community-level analyses can be applied. On the other hand, joint species distribution models (JSDMs) [@Pollock2014UndCoo] try to improve species distribution predictions by incorporating species co-occurrence into the models. However, these models do not always improve community-level predictions compared to S-SDMs [@Norberg2019ComEva; @Zurell2020TesSpe]. S-SDMs also tend to overestimate species richness [@Dubuis2011PreSpa; @DAmen2015UsiSpe; @Zurell2020TesSpe], which could result from thresholding the probabilities into presence-absence data before stacking the species distributions [@Calabrese2014StaSpe]. Summing the occurrence probabilities without applying a threshold is, therefore, another alternative [@Calabrese2014StaSpe]. However, this may limit some analyses as it does not return species identities for every site [@Zurell2020TesSpe], as is required with LCBD calculations. Spatially explicit species assemblage modelling (SESAM) [@Guisan2011SesNew], hierarchical modelling of species communities (HMSC) [@Ovaskainen2017HowMak], and Bayesian networks (BN) [@Staniczenko2017LinMac] are other alternatives that could yield better community predictions than S-SDMs. However, they add methodological and computational overload, impeding their use for broad spatial extents, and are often validated against extensive work on species richness. By comparison, ecological uniqueness and LCBD indices have rarely been used in predictive frameworks. Therefore, S-SDMs may prove an appropriate first step to establish some baselines, especially given that calculating LCBD values on SDM predictions will raise some important issues, such as calculating the uniqueness scores on much bigger community matrices and broader scales than what is typically done.

The total number of sites will increase (1) because of the spatially continuous nature of the predictions, as there will be more sites in the region of interest than the number of sampled sites, and (2) because of the larger spatial extent allowed for the SDM predictions. A high number of SDM-predicted sites with a large extent opens up the possibility of capturing a lot of variability of habitats­ and community composition, but also many very similar ones. This could change the way that exceptional sites contribute to the overall variance in the large-scale community. 

LCBD scores have typically been used at local or regional scales with relatively few sites [@Legendre2013BetDiv; @daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe]. Some studies did use the measure over broader, near-continental extents [@Yang2015ComSim; @Poisot2017HosPar; @Taranu2020LarMul], but the total number of sites in these studies was relatively small. Recent studies also investigated LCBD and beta diversity on sites distributed in contiguous grids or as pixels, hence uniform sampling intervals and no spatial gaps, but these did not cover large extents and a high number of sites [@Tan2017HowBet; @Tan2019UndPro; @Legendre2019SpaTem; @DAntraccoli2020MorSpe]. Two recent studies have, however, adopted promising predictive approaches on regional extents. First, @Niskanen2017DriHig predicted LCBD values of plant communities (and three other diversity measures) on a continuous scale and a high number of sites (> 25,000) using Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). However, they modelled the diversity measures directly after calculating them on a smaller number of sampled sites. They obtained lower predictive accuracy for LCBD than for the other diversity measures, highlighting the challenge to predict the measure. Second, @Vasconcelos2018ExpImp used ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict anurans ecological niches according to actual and forecasted environmental conditions, then calculated the LCBD values on the predictions to identify biodiversity hotspots. Using this approach, predicted LCBD values are calculated in a closer way to the original formulation based on community composition. This development of predictive approaches is exciting, especially as it could be pushed a step further to continental extents, a higher number of sites, and more species occurrences using SDMs and massive data sources. Still, it should be accompanied by an investigation of the determinant of ecological uniqueness in such conditions.

Measuring ecological uniqueness from LCBD indices over broad spatial extents and spatially continuous data also raises the question of which sites will be identified as exceptional and for what reason. The method intends that sites should stand out and receive a high LCBD score whenever they display an exceptional community composition, be it a unique assemblage of species that may have a high conservation value or a richer or poorer community than most in the region [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Both the original study and many of the later empirical ones have shown a negative relationship between LCBD scores and species richness [@Legendre2013BetDiv; @daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe], although other studies observed both negative and positive relationships at different sites [@Kong2017SpaVar] or quadrats [@Yao2021EcoUni]. Some studies showed that the direction of the relationship is related to the percentage of rare species in the community [@daSilva2018DisCor; @Yao2021EcoUni]. The LCBD-richness relationship and the effect of the proportion of rare species should therefore be investigated over broad spatial extents, as beta diversity and species rarity are both concepts that depend on scale. For instance, total beta diversity increases with spatial extent [@Barton2013SpaSca] and is strongly dependent on scale, notably because of higher environmental heterogeneity and sampling of different local species pool [@Heino2015ComAna], which could potentially add some variation to the relationship. 

Here, we examine whether the LCBD method can assess ecological uniqueness over broad spatial extents based on predictions of species distributions and evaluate the effect of scale changes on beta diversity quantification. We first predicted species distributions on continental scales using extended occurrence data from eBird and Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs). We then quantified uniqueness with the local contributions to beta diversity measure for both predicted and observed data. Next, we examined the site-wise difference using direct comparison, a spatial autocorrelation test, and generalized linear regression. We then investigated the relationship between uniqueness and species richness for different regions and scales and according to the proportion of rare species.

# Methods

## Occurrence data

We used occurrence data from eBird [@Sullivan2009EbiCit] downloaded through the eBird Basic Data set from June 2019 [@eBirdBasicDataset2019VerEbd]. We restricted our analyses to the New World warbler family (_Parulidae_) in North America (Canada, United States, Mexico) using the _R_ package `auk` [@Strimas-Mackey2018AukEbi] to extract and process bird sightings records from the eBird database. eBird is a semi-structured citizen science data set, meaning that observations are reported as checklists of species detected in an observation run [@Johnston2020AnaGui]. Observers can explicitly specify that their checklist contains all species they could detect and identify during a sampling event, in which case it is labelled as a "complete checklist." Using complete checklists instead of regular checklists allows researchers to infer non-detections in locations where detection efforts did occur, which offers performance gains in species distribution models [@Johnston2020AnaGui]. Therefore, we selected the data from the complete checklists only. Our final data set comprised 62 warbler species and nearly **23 million** observations from **9** million checklists. Warblers are a diverse group with many species, are popular among birders given their charismatic aspect, are distributed in diverse areas and present relatively everywhere in North America.

## Environmental data

Our environmental data consisted of climatic data from the WorldClim 2.1 database [@Fick2017Wor2N] and land cover data from the Copernicus Global Land Service [@Buchhorn2019CopGlo]. We restricted these data to a spatial extent comprised between -145.0 and -50.0 degrees of longitude and between 20.0 and 75.0 degrees of latitude ([@Fig:maps]). First, the WorldClim data consists of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas. We used the standard _bioClim_ variables from WorldClim 2.1, which represent annual trends, ranges, and extremes of temperature and precipitation, but selected only 8 out of the 19 ones to avoid redundancy (bio1, bio2, bio5, bio6, bio12, bio13, bio14, bio15). We downloaded the data at a resolution of 10 arcminutes (around 18 km² at the equator), the coarsest resolution available, using the _Julia_ package `SimpleSDMLayers.jl` [@Dansereau2021SimJl]. The coarse resolution should mitigate potential imprecision in the eBird data regarding the extent of the sampled areas in each observation checklist. Moreover, some studies have argued that coarser resolutions lead to less overestimation of species richness and better identification of bird biodiversity hotspots given the patchiness of observation data [@Hurlbert2007SpeRic]. We acknowledge that using an arcminutes-based resolution means that the surface area of our pixels will not be equal depending on the latitude. Second, the Copernicus data is a set of variables representing ten land cover classes (e.g., crops, trees, urban areas) and measured as a percentage of land cover. The data is only available at a finer resolution of 100 m, which we downloaded directly from the website. We coarsened it to the same ten arcminute resolution as the WorldClim data by averaging the pixels' cover fraction values with `GDAL` [@GDAL/OGRcontributors2021GdaOgr]. We first selected the ten land cover variables but later removed two (moss and snow) from our predictive models. Their cover fraction was 0% on all sites with warbler observations; hence they did not provide any predictive value to our SDM models.

## Species distribution models

We converted the occurrence data to a presence-absence format compatible with community analyses. We considered every pixel from our ten arcminutes environmental layers as a site. We then verified, for each species, if there was a single observation in every site. Finally, we recorded the outcome as a binary value: present (1) if a species was ever recorded in a site and absent (0) if it was not. Complete checklists help ensure that these zeros represent non-detections, rather than the species not being reported; hence we considered them as absence data, similar to @Johnston2020AnaGui, although we recognize that there subsists a doubt about this.

We predicted species distribution data on continuous scales from our presence-absence data using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BARTs) [@Chipman2010BarBay], a classification and regression trees method recently suggested for species distribution modelling [@Carlson2020EmbSpe]. BARTs are sum-of-trees models, conceptually similar to Boosted Regression Trees and Random Forest, but following a Bayesian paradigm: trees are constrained as weak learners by priors regarding structure and nodes [@Chipman2010BarBay; @Carlson2020EmbSpe]. Then, fitting and inference is made through an iterative Bayesian backfitting Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm generating a posterior distribution of predicted classification probabilities [@Chipman2010BarBay; @Carlson2020EmbSpe]. We used the package `embarcadero` [@Carlson2020EmbSpe] in _R_ to compute the BART models. First, we performed BARTs separately for all species and estimated the probability of occurrence for all the sites in the pseudo-rectangular spatial units of 10 arcminutes in the region of interest. We then converted the results to a binary outcome according to the threshold that maximized the True Skill Statistic (TSS) for each species, as suggested by @Carlson2020EmbSpe. 

## Quantification of ecological uniqueness

We used the method of @Legendre2013BetDiv to quantify compositional uniqueness from overall beta diversity for both the observed and predicted data. First, we assembled the presence-absence data by site to form two site-by-species community matrices, one from observed data, called $Y$ (**39,091** sites by 62 species), and one from predicted data, called $\hat Y$ (**99,609** sites by 62 species). Next, we measured species richness per site as the sum of the presences in each row, i.e., the number of species present. Finally, we removed the sites without any species from the predicted community matrix $\hat Y$, for a new total of **92,117** sites (this was not necessary for the observed community matrix $Y$, as it was, by design, only composed of sites with at least one species present). We applied the Hellinger transformation to both matrices, as recommended by @Legendre2013BetDiv for presence-absence data. We then measured total beta diversity as the variance of the community matrices and calculated the local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), which quantify how much a specific site (a row in each matrix) contributes to the overall variance in the community [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. High LCBD values indicate a unique community composition, while low values indicate a more common species set. Measuring beta diversity as the variance of the community matrices offers a critical advantage in computations in this case, as alternative approaches based on sites' pairwise dissimilarity would require a much higher number of calculations given the high number of sites in our study. We note that our LCBD values, which add up to 1 because the raw LCBD values are divided by the total sum-of-squares of the data matrix, were very low given the high number of sites in both $Y$ and $\hat Y$. However, the relative difference between the scores in one set matters more than the absolute value to differentiate their uniqueness.

## Comparison of observed and predicted values

We performed three verification to compare the species richness and uniqueness estimates obtained from our predicted species distributions to those obtained with the occurrence data from eBird. First, we performed a direct comparison by subtracting the richness and LCBD estimates obtained from $Y$ (the observed data) from the estimates obtained from $\hat{Y}$ (the predicted data). To do so, we used the richness estimates as-is but modified the LCBD values to achieve a non-biased comparison, given that the original values are calculated for the same sites but on sets of different lengths. Therefore, we recomputed the LCBD scores only for the sites for which we had occurrences in both $Y$ and $\hat{Y}$, which mostly corresponded to the sites in $Y$, minus a few sites where the SDMs predicted no species occurrence. We then plotted the richness and LCBD differences to examine their spatial distributions. Second, we performed the modified _t_ test from @Clifford1989AssSig to assess the correlation between the observed and predicted estimates and test for spatial autocorrelation. We performed the test separately for the richness and the LCBD estimates. We used the `modified.ttest` function from the package `SpatialPack` [@Vallejos2020SpaRel] in _R_. Third, we performed Generalized Linear Models between the observed and predicted estimates and plotted the deviance residuals to examine their spatial distribution. We used a negative binomial regression with a log link function using the package `MASS` [@Venables2002ModApp] in _R_ for the richness estimates as our values showed overdispersion [@Fletcher2018SpaEco]. We used a beta regression with a logit link function using the package `betareg` [@Cribari-Neto2010BetReg] for the LCBD values as they vary between 0 and 1, similar to @Heino2017ExpSpe and @Yao2021EcoUni.

## Investigation of regional and scaling variation

We recalculated LCBD values on various subregions at different locations and scales to investigate possible regional and scaling effects. First, we selected two subregions of equivalent sizes (20.0 longitude degrees by 10.0 latitude degrees) with contrasting richness profiles to verify if the relationship between species richness and LCBD values was similar. We selected a Northeast subregion (longitude between -80.0 and -60.0, latitude between 40.0 and 50.0), mostly species-rich, and a Southwest subregion (longitude between -120.0 and 100.0, latitude between 30.0 and 40.0), mostly species-poor (for both the observed and predicted data). @Fig:subareas shows the coordinates and spatial extents of both subregions. Second, we recalculated the LCBD indices at three different extents, starting with a focus on the Northeast subregion and progressively extending the extent to encompass the Southwest subregion ([@Fig:extents]). These are conceptually similar to the spatial windows of @Barton2013SpaSca, which allow one to study the variation of beta diversity according to spatial extent. We did these two verifications with both the observed and predicted data but only illustrate the results with the predicted data as both were qualitatively similar.

## Proportion of rare species

We investigated the effect of the proportion of rare species in the community on the direction of the relationship between species richness and LCBD values in our Northeast and Southwest subregions. Following @DeCaceres2012VarTre and @Yao2021EcoUni, we classified species as rare when they occurred in less than 40% of the sites in each subregion. We calculated the proportion of rare species for every site. We then grouped the sites for both subregions depending on whether they were part of an ascending or a descending portion in the LCBD-richness relationship. Given that the relationship sometimes displays a curvilinear form with a positive quadratic term [@Heino2017ExpSpe; @Tan2019UndPro], we separated the ascending and descending portions based on the species richness at the site with the lowest LCBD value (we used the median richness if there were multiple sites with the lowest LCBD value), which corresponds to the inflection point of the relationships shown on @Fig:subareas. For example, the lowest LCBD value was **7.032e-5** in the Northeast subregion and the median richness (as there were multiple sites with this LCBD value) was **23**. All the sites with more than **23** species were assigned to the ascending portion, and all the sites with **23** species or fewer were assigned to the descending portion. In the Southwest subregion, the lowest LCBD value and its corresponding (median) richness were **6.035e-5** and **12**, respectively. We then mapped the ascending and descending groups to view their spatial distribution. We also examined the distribution of the rare species proportions in both groups using a density plot. Similar to our previous verification, we performed this analysis with both observed and predicted data but once again only illustrate the results with the predicted data as both were qualitatively similar.

## Software

We used _Julia v1.6.1_ [@Bezanson2017JulFre] for most of the project and _R v4.0.2_ [@RCoreTeam2020RLan] for some specific steps. We used the _Julia_ package `SimpleSDMLayers.jl` [@Dansereau2021SimJl] as the basic framework for our analyses, to download the WorldClim 2.1 data, and to map our results through the package's integration of `Plots.jl`. We also used `StatsPlots.jl` to produce the density plots in our rare species analysis. We computed the LCBD indices with our own function implemented in _Julia_, whose results were verified by comparison to the `beta.div` function from the package `adespatial`[@Dray2021AdeMul] in _R_. We used the _R_ packages `auk` [@Strimas-Mackey2018AukEbi] to extract and manipulate eBird data, `embarcadero` [@Carlson2020EmbSpe] to perform the BART models, `vegan` [@Oksanen2019VegCom] to perform the Hellinger transformations, `SpatialPack` to perform the modified _t_ test, as well as `MASS` [@Venables2002ModApp] and `betareg` [@Cribari-Neto2010BetReg] to perform the negative binomial and beta regressions, respectively. We used `GDAL` [@GDAL/OGRcontributors2021GdaOgr] to coarsen the Copernicus land cover data. All the scripts used for the analyses are available at <https://github.com/gabrieldansereau/betadiversity-hotspots>.

# Results

## Species distribution models generate relevant community predictions

Species richness from observation data ([@Fig:maps]a) was higher on the East Coast and lower on the West Coast, with many unsampled patches in the North, Midwest, and Southwest. Richness results from SDM data ([@Fig:maps]b) displayed higher richness on the East Coast and sites with few or no species up north and in the Midwest. There was no clear latitudinal gradient in richness but rather an East-West one. Landmarks such as the Rockies and croplands in the Midwest (which should be species-poor habitats) were notably visible on the maps, separating the East and West. LCBD scores from observation data ([@Fig:maps]c) were low on the East Coast and higher on the border of sampled sites in the Midwest. They were also higher in the North and in the South, where observations were sparser. Results from SDM predictions were qualitatively similar ([@Fig:maps]d), with lower LCBD values in the East and more unique sites in the Midwest region, Central Mexico, and some Northern regions. There was no clear latitudinal gradient, and the East-West contrast, while present, was less clear than on the richness maps. LCBD values ranged between **1.444e-5** and **5.860e-5** for observation data and between **5.788e-6** and **1.706e-5** for SDM data. The total beta diversity was **0.608** for the observation data and **0.775** for the SDM data.

We measured species richness after converting the occurrence data from eBird (a) and the SDM predictions from our single-species BART models (b) to a presence-absence format per species. We applied the Hellinger transformation to the presence-absence data, then calculated the LCBD values from the variance of the community matrices, separately for the occurrence data (c) and the SDM predictions (d). LCBD values ranged between **1.444e-5** and **5.860e-5** for observation data and between **5.788e-6** and **1.706e-5** for SDM data.

Areas in light grey (not on the colour scale) represent mainland sites with environmental data but without any warbler species present.](figures/comparison-combined.png){#fig:maps}

The modified _t_ test of @Clifford1989AssSig showed high correlation between the observed and predicted estimates of richness and uniqueness, as well as spatial autocorrelation in the values. For species richness, the correlation coefficient was **0.7802**, the _F_-statistic was **20,162**, and the p-value was **6.126e-04**. For LCBD scores, the correlation coefficient was **0.5207**, the _F_-statistic was **40,942**, and the p-value was **3.936e-09**.

The difference between the observed and predicted estimates (predicted richness - observed richness and predicted LCBD - observed LCBD) showed opposite geographic distributions for species richness and ecological uniqueness ([@Fig:comparison-combined]). Predicted richness estimates were higher than observed estimates on the East Coast in particular as well as on the West Coast and in Mexico, but were lower than observed estimates in the Midwest ([@Fig:comparison-combined]a). Predicted LCBD estimates, on the other hand, were lower than observed estimates on the East Coast and higher in the Midwest ([@Fig:comparison-combined]b). Regression residuals showed similar geographic distributions to their corresponding difference values ([@Fig:residuals-combined]).

## Uniqueness displays regional variation as two distinct profiles

The relationship between LCBD values and species richness displayed contrasting profiles in species-rich and species-poor regions ([@Fig:subareas]). In the species-rich northeastern region of our study extent (North America), LCBD scores displayed a mostly decreasing relationship with species richness, with a slightly curvilinear form and increase of values for very rich sites. The sites with the highest LCBD values, i.e., the unique ones in terms of species composition, were the species-poor sites, while the species-rich sites displayed lower LCBD scores. The Southwest subarea showed a different relationship with a much sharper initial decline and a more significant increase as richness reaches 20 species. The sites with the highest LCBD values were the poorest ones in terms of species richness, as in the Northeast region, but the species-rich sites were proportionally more unique in the Southwest region. Total beta diversity was also higher in the Southwest subregion (**0.441**) than in the Northeast one (**0.176**), indicating higher compositional differences between the sites. LCBD values ranged between **7.032e-5** and **1.333e-3** for the Northeast subregion and between **6.035e-5** and **5.236e-4** for the Southwest one.

## Uniqueness depends on the scale on which it is measured

The LCBD-richness relationship showed important variation when scaling up and changing the region's extent ([@Fig:extents]). For smaller extents, starting with a species-rich region, the relationship is well defined, decreasing, and curvilinear. However, as the extent increases and progressively reaches species-poor regions, the relationship broadens, displays more variance, and loses its curvilinear aspect while keeping a decreasing form. Total beta diversity was higher when increasing the spatial extent, going from **0.116** to **0.279** and **0.682**. LCBD values ranged between **2.195e-4** and **5.209e-3** at the finest scale, between **1.478e-4** and **3.500e-3** at the intermediate one, and between **1.179e-05** and **5.218e-05** at the broadest one.

LCBD values ranged between **2.195e-4** and **5.209e-3** at the finest scale, between **1.478e-4** and **3.500e-3** at the intermediate one, and between **1.179e-05** and **5.218e-05** at the broadest one.

## Uniqueness depends on the proportion of rare species

The proportion of rare species differed depending on the classification of sites in the ascending or descending portions of the LCBD-richness relationship ([@Fig:rarespecies]). The proportion of rare species was higher in the sites corresponding to the ascending portions of the relationships shown in [@Fig:subareas] than in the sites corresponding to the descending portions for both subregions. The classification of the sites in the two portions showed a clear latitudinal gradient in the Northeast subregion, while it was distributed in patches in the Southwest subregion.

The right side figures are density plots of the proportion of rare species in each group. Species were classified as rare when they occurred in fewer than 40% of the sites in the subregion.

# Discussion

Our results showed a decreasing relationship between species richness and LCBD values on broad spatial extents ([@Fig:extents]c) but also highlighted that the exact form of this relationship varies depending on the region and the spatial extent on which it is measured. Our species-rich Northeast subregion ([@Fig:subareas]a) showed a decreasing relationship, very similar to previous studies, and slightly curvilinear, as described by @Heino2017ExpSpe and @Tan2019UndPro. This result for warbler species is in line with the original study on fish communities [@Legendre2013BetDiv] and with following ones on insect metacommunities [@daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe], dung beetles [@daSilva2018DisCor; @daSilva2020CanTax], aquatic beetles [@Heino2019KniPat], stream macroinvertebrates [@Sor2018UniSam], stream diatoms [@Vilmi2017EcoUni], multi-trophic pelagic food webs (phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish) [@Taranu2020LarMul], temperate forest trees [@Tan2019UndPro], mammals (medium-to-large, small, volant) [@daSilva2020CanTax], wetland birds [@deDeus2020AviBet], and a few other phylogenetic groups (plants, lizards, mites, anurans, mesoinvertebrates) [@Landeiro2018SpeLow]. However, it was originally argued that the negative relationship was not general or obligatory [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Different LCBD-richness relationships have also been observed, with both positive and negative relationships for different sites or taxonomic groups in some studies [@Kong2017SpaVar; @Teittinen2017LocGeo], as well as a negative relationship with the number of common species but a positive relationship with the number of rare species [@Qiao2015BetDiv]. 

Our results further show that the relationship may depend on the region's richness profile, as the relationship was different in our species-poor Southwest subregion, with a sharper initial decrease ([@Fig:subareas]b). Therefore, the curvilinear form may depend on how big the contrast will be between the region's median richness and its richest ecologically possible sites. 

The variation in the LCBD-richness relationship when scaling up and changing the overall study extent showed that the uniqueness patterns highlighted are not necessarily the same depending on the scale on which it is used ([@Fig:extents]). The subregions' uniqueness profiles will merge at broad spatial scales, but this can create a new profile with a lot more variation. When too many poor sites are present, rich sites will almost certainly have lower LCBD values. Aggregating too many different sites might then possibly mask some patterns of uniqueness. Total beta diversity, on the other hand, showed the variation expected from previous studies, increasing with spatial extent ([@Fig:extents]) [@Barton2013SpaSca; @Heino2015ComAna]. Its value was high at the continental scale (**0.628**) but lower than what has been observed in some studies (e.g. 0.80 in @Sor2018UniSam).

Our results confirm that the proportion of rare species in the community may have an effect on the direction of the relationship between species richness and ecological uniqueness ([@Fig:rarespecies]). @daSilva2018DisCor suggested that the proportion of rare and common species in the communities seems to determine if the relationship will be negative, non-significant, or positive. @Yao2021EcoUni supported this idea and showed that the relationship was negative when the proportion of rare species was lower and positive when the relationship was high. Our results further show that sites associated with a positive relationship within a curvilinear one tended to have a higher rare species proportion ([@Fig:rarespecies]). This also implies that the proportion of rare species was higher in species-rich sites than in species-poor ones in both our Northeast and Southwest subregions. Further work should attempt to disentangle the effects of the rare species proportion and of the region's richness profile.

Our results showed that SDM models provide richness and uniqueness predictions highly correlated to the occurrence data while filling gaps in poorly sampled regions ([@Fig:maps]). However, the results showed spatial autocorrelation and tended to underestimate uniqueness in species-rich regions and overestimate it in species-poor ones ([@Fig:comparison-combined; @Fig:residuals-combined]). Overprediction of richness using S-SDMs was reported previously [@Dubuis2011PreSpa; @DAmen2015UsiSpe; @Zurell2020TesSpe]. Predictive approaches and spatial structures have been less studied for LCBD values compared to species richness, but some studies did show that LCBD distributions were spatially structured across sampling sites [@daSilva2018DisCor]. 

Our results over broad spatial extents did not concord exactly with those of @Heino2019KniPat, as LCBD scores increased both in the North and South, hence did not strictly increase with latitude, and also showed a clear East-West gradient. Nonetheless, the predictions for regions with sparse sampling are of interest as they allow a quantitative evaluation, however imperfect, for sites where we would otherwise have no information. 

Our SDMs also offered relevant LCBD predictions using eBird, arguably one of the largest presence-absence data sets available (when using its complete checklist system), and showed the measure's potential on such massive data. These two elements open up new opportunities for LCBD analyses on extended spatial scales, as well as for the diversity of taxons to which this type of analysis can be applied. An interesting way forward would be to test these results using more advanced community assembling techniques than S-SDMs. The use SESAM with probabilistic SDMs, probability ranking, and species richness predictions as macroecological constraints returns high site-level prediction accuracy [@Zurell2020TesSpe] and would be compatible with presence-absence LCBD calculations. The use of probabilistic stacks rather than binary ones [@Calabrese2014StaSpe] could also constitute a novel way to calculate LCBD indices. Both these procedures should reduce the richness deviation we observed, and it would be interesting to verify if this can also be the case with LCBD values. Overall, our distribution results have implications for conservation, as they confirm that species richness and ecological uniqueness measured from LCBD values may conflict and highlight different potential hotspots [@Dubois2020EcoUni; @Yao2021EcoUni], thus reinstating the need to protect both with complementary strategies.

This study showed how ecological uniqueness can be measured on broad spatial extents, including for regions with sparse sampling, and how scale changes may affect beta diversity quantification. First, the negative relationship often observed between species richness and local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) can take different forms depending on the richness profile of the regions on which it is measured. Therefore, species-rich and species-poor regions may display different ways to be unique. Second, the negative relationship is not constant when varying the spatial study extent and may be less clearly defined at broad scales when contrasting regional relationships are present, even creating a new, distinct one. Finally, species distribution models (SDMs) offer a promising way to generate uniqueness predictions on broad spatial extents and could prove useful to identify beta diversity hotspots in unsampled locations on large spatial scales, which could be important targets for conservation purposes.
